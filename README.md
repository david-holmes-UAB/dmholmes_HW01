This assignment involved creating a program to answer a set of five questions based on the provided data sheet.  
In order to accomplish this, structures were used to store and access data taken in from the students_datasheet.csv file.  
There are two structures - one for the departments/majors, and one for the students themselves. Once stored in an array, the student data was then used to fill another array with department data. Together, these two arrays were used to access and manipulate the data to answer the provided questions.

In addition to this, another array was used to store the names of the advisors in the file to check if they belonged to a department.
